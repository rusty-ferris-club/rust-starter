#
# == This is a dual CLI + library crate. ==
#
# * To turn this into a pure library crate, remove [[features]] and [[bin]],
#   and remove optional deps.
# * To turn into a pure CLI crate, do the same as before, but don't remove
#   optional deps, turn them into non-optional.
#
# To use both as dual crate:
#
# 1. For a CLI, nothing needs to be done.
# 2. For a library, build using `--no-default-features`, and depend using `default-features = false`
#

# swaps:
# anything with __V_
